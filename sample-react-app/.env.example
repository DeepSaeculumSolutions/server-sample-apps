#  Sample React App - Environment Variables
# =============================================================
#  Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.
#  All Vite env variables must start with VITE_ prefix.
# =============================================================

# --- API Configuration ---
# URL of the Node.js backend API that this frontend connects to.
#
# TASK: Set this to the URL where your sample-node-api is running.
#
# For local development (running outside Docker):
#   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
#
# For docker-compose deployment (use the service name or host IP):
#   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
#
# NOTE: Even inside docker-compose, the React app runs in the BROWSER,
#       so the API URL must be reachable from the browser, NOT from
#       inside the Docker network. Use localhost:<exposed_port> or
#       your server's IP/domain.
#
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
